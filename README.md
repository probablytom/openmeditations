# openmeditations
An open source platform for hosting a web server for logging meditations.

This project is in an incredibly early stage, but the idea is to have a program that allows people to record snippets of thought and wisdom they have day-to-day in an *unobtrusive* fashion. 
The nature of this is entirely open to change, as the project iss till being conveived properly. Could be curious though.
